 - PyTorch (`torch`) v1.2.0 with CUDA 9.0;
 - Torchvision (`torchvision`) v0.4.0;
 - Numpy (`numpy`) v1.14.5;
 - Imblearn (`imblearn`) v0.5.0;
 - Cnn_finetune (`cnn_finetune`) v0.6.0;
 - PIL (`PIL`) v6.1.0;
 - Scikit-learn (`sklearn`) v0.21.3;
 - Scipy (`scipy`) v1.1.0;
 - Csv (`csv`) v1.0.
 - math, os, collections, pylab.
 
## Datasets

The datasets manipulated in this code can be downloaded on the following locations:
1. LFWface:
  - Baiduyun: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1QIM8ZVbitRopECfGCKTaZg,    Extraction code: 39t9;

2. animal:
  - Baiduyun: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dTd80kqvT7TnSZZcVdeVZA,    Extraction code: ixqe.  

Download correspond dataset to folder 'data'.

## Training

1. To train the baseline model: 
 - LFWface
```train
cd /focus/code_face
python train_baseline.py
```
 - animal
 ```train
cd /focus/code_animal
python train_baseline.py
```
2. To train the best model in the paper, run this command:
 - LFWface
```train
cd /focus/code_face
python train_caps_cam.py
```
 - animal
 ```train
cd /focus/code_animal
python train_caps_cam.py
```
When training this model, if training accuracy does not increase, multiply the learning rate by 0.1.

## Evaluation

1. To evaluate the baseline model on LFWface/animal, run:
```eval
cd /focus/code_face or cd /focus/code_animal
python test_baseline.py 
```
2. To evaluate our model on LFWface/animal, run:
```eval
cd /focus/code_face or cd /focus/code_animal
python test_caps_cam.py 
```
